# MeanApp

A simple app using MongoDB, Express, Angular2, and NodeJS. This app was simply made for
improving my skills in node and learning how to use MongoDB and Angular2.

The app is fairly simple. All it does is record tasks that you want to do. You can add
new tasks, check them off, and delete them.
